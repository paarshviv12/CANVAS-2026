# Canvas 2026 🖌️

A nostalgic, audio-visual interactive HTML `<canvas>` experience titled "Welcome to 2026". 

Featuring the reflective theme "Where did all the time go?", the application pairs a retro starry-night aesthetic and floating, animated bubbles with a musical soundtrack to create an ambient, script-driven digital art piece that users must 'Start' to enter.

## 🌟 Features
- **Canvas Interactions:** Complex drawing algorithms leveraging standard HTML5 web APIs to draw 2D bubbles.
- **Dynamic Render:** Custom animations running smoothly in real-time.
- **Multimedia Integration:** Audio playback capabilities (`where_all_the_time_go.mp3`) synced to the visual state's initiation.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5 Canvas:** For real-time 2D graphics rendering.
- **CSS3:** Positioning and aesthetic foundations surrounding the canvas elements.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Powers the animations, interactions, and events cleanly.
